 * Description:
 * AIDEme is a large-scale interactive data exploration system that is cast in a principled active learning (AL) framework: in this context,
 * we consider the data content as a large set of records in a data source, and the user is interested in some of them but not all.
 * In the data exploration process, the system allows the user to label a record as “interesting” or “not interesting” in each iteration,
 * so that it can construct an increasingly-more-accurate model of the user interest. Active learning techniques are employed to select
 * a new record from the unlabeled data source in each iteration for the user to label next in order to improve the model accuracy.
 * Upon convergence, the model is run through the entire data source to retrieve all relevant records.

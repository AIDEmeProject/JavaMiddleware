  ~ Description:
  ~ AIDEme is a large-scale interactive data exploration system that is cast in a principled active learning (AL) framework: in this context,
  ~ we consider the data content as a large set of records in a data source, and the user is interested in some of them but not all.
  ~ In the data exploration process, the system allows the user to label a record as “interesting” or “not interesting” in each iteration,
  ~ so that it can construct an increasingly-more-accurate model of the user interest. Active learning techniques are employed to select
  ~ a new record from the unlabeled data source in each iteration for the user to label next in order to improve the model accuracy.
  ~ Upon convergence, the model is run through the entire data source to retrieve all relevant records.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
